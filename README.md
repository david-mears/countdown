# Countdown

Hosted (for now) at [david-mears.github.io/countdown](https://david-mears.github.io/countdown)

To migrate this website across to /makersacademy (where I don't have permissions to create repos), fork this repo, click Settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages, and click the link to the website. Finally, update this README.

To add a custom domain, see:

https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site

By default, GitHub Pages projects use the `gh-pages` branch as the publishing source. To update the webpage, update that branch.
